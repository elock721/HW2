# HW2

For this project I created a self marketing portfolio website 

Included are 3 html files (index, portfolio and contact) that all have links to each other and communicate properly 

Used Bootstrap and Bootswatch to create an aesthetically pleasing application complete with grid and columns

Nav bar at top of page with links to "About Me" bio, portfolio, and contact page

About Me page complete with photo, bio and full name on bootstrap card

Portfolio consisting of 6 different personal travel photos on bootstrap contact cards 

Interactive contact page with option to email from bootswatch

Sticky nav bar at the bottom with access to all three pages
